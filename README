You probably want to just do

make install

in this directory. That will create a .a and a .so file and instal
them in ~/lib and will copy the .H file to ~/include

----------------------------------

make options

build: build the libraries in the source directory.

install: copy the libraries and header files to install directories.

clean: remove object and library files from source directories but
does not touch install directories

uninstall: remove libraries and header files from install directories. 

-----------------------------------

To change the installation location:

This make uses $(prefix) as the base of the installation
location. That means libraries go to $(prefix)/lib and headers go to
$(prefix)/include. The default value for prefix is ~. To specify a
different value for prefix do this:

make install prefix=<alternate base directory>
